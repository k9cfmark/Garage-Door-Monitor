# Garage-Door-Monitor
Forgot to close your Garage Door, a reliable backup will close it.  Any Arduino, HC-SR04 sonic ranger and relay

We have a roll up Garage Door.
We occasionaly drive off with out verifying that the push button remote actually worked and closed the garage.
We end up comming back after 9 hours of work to find out that we've been depending upon the honesty of strangers not to help them selves to my bicycle and then walk into the unlocked house.
I didn't want to depend upon some limit switch.  I thought of using a camera but discarded that idea.  
An electric eye with a beam would be odd....
Sonar...Yes sonar.  
This is now mounted on the celeing about 3 feet from the roll up door spinner.
When the door opens the distance from the celing to the door shows about 15 CM.
When the door is closed the distance from the celing to the FLOOR is close to 3000cm (or three meters).

I push this to get up under the unlisiense licenes in the hopes it would be useful, or educational, or fun. 
But if it F#(Ks up and leaves your door open, and your gold fish are eaten, don't come after me.
